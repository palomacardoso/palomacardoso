🙋 Hello World, I’m Paloma!

I currently work as a Programming Teacher for children at Byjus Future School, where I teach game creation using Javascript.
Afterwards I interned as a HelpDesk at TVM Informática, where I provided Technical Support directly to users with network problems.
And I've already been an intern at the Scientific Police, where I could learn to develop criminal reports and carry out expertise in electronic and ballistic equipment.

👀 I’m interested in share my projects and knowledges with the community and to be able to help and being helped with the codes 😀

🌱 I’m currently learning ReactJS. But to be honest, I have a Check-List lol

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on frontend projects for right now
